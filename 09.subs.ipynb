A common task in molecular biology is to search \nan organism's genome for a known motif.\n\nThe situation is complicated by the fact that genomes are riddled with intervals of DNA that occur multiple \ntimes (possibly with slight modifications), called repeats. These repeats occur far more often than would be \ndictated by random chance, indicating that genomes are anything but random and in fact illustrate that the \nlanguage of DNA must be very powerful (compare with the frequent reuse of common words in any human language).\n\nThe most common repeat in humans is the Alu repeat, which is approximately 300 bp long and recurs around a \nmillion times throughout every human genome. However, Alu has not been found to serve a positive purpose, and \nappears in fact to be parasitic: when a new Alu repeat is inserted into a genome, it frequently causes genetic \ndisorders.\n\n## Problem\n\nGiven two strings $s$ and $t$, $t$ is a substring of $s$ if $t$ is contained as a contiguous collection of \nsymbols in $s$ (as a result, $t$ must be no longer than $s$).\n\nThe position of a symbol in a string is the total number of symbols found to its left, including itself (e.g., \nthe positions of all occurrences of 'U' in \"AUGCUUCAGAAAGGUCUUACG\" are 2, 5, 6, 15, 17, and 18). The symbol at \nposition $i$ of $s$ is denoted by $s[i]$.\n\nA substring of $s$ can be represented as $s[j:k]$, where $j$ and $k$ represent the starting and ending positions \nof the substring in $s$; for example, if $s$ = \"AUGCUUCAGAAAGGUCUUACG\", then $s[2:5]$ = \"UGCU\".\n\nThe location of a substring $s[j:k]$ is its beginning position $j$; note that $t$ will have multiple locations \nin $s$ if it occurs more than once as a substring of $s$ (see the Sample below).\n\n__Given__: Two DNA strings $s$ and $t$ (each of length at most 1 kbp).\n\n__Return__: All locations of $t$ as a substring of $s$.\n\n## Sample Dataset\n```\nGATATATGCATATACTT\nATAT\n```\n\n## Sample Output\n```\n2 4 10\n```","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"e44679bd-d662-4d97-bfcd-05534a01f461"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"f1096be0-67c6-4a8f-87d2-bb091b22284b"},"source":"def findMotif(s,t):\n    motifLen = len(t)\n    pos = []\n    for i in range(len(s) - len(t)):\n        if (s[i:i+len(t)] == t):\n            pos += [i+1]\n    return pos\n\nfindMotif(\"GATATATGCATATACTT\", \"ATAT\")","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":3,"data":{"text/plain":"[2, 4, 10]"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"s = \"GCCCGCACACCCGCACAACCCGCACAGCACCCGCACACCCGCACTTATTCCCGCACGCCCGCACCCCGCACCCACGCCCGCACCCCGCACTTGCCCGCACCCCGCACGTCCCGCACGCCTACCCGCACCCCGCACGACCCGCACCGTTTGGCGTCAATCCCCCGCACCGGCCCGCACATCCCCGCACCTGCCCGCACTCCCGCACCCCCGCACTCTAGATGAGGCCCGCACTCCCGCACCCCGCACTCCCCGCACTGGGCCCGCACGACACCCGCACGTACCCGCACTCCCCGCACCCCGCACTGTGCCCCGCACGGCCCGCACCGTCCCGCACCCCGCACTAGGCCCGCACTACTTCCCCGCACCCCGCACAGCCCCCGCACGCCCGCACCCCGCACGCCCGCACGCCCGCACCCCGCACCCCGCACTCCCGCACTGCTCCCCCGCACCGCCCGCACACCCGCACCCCGCACTCCCGCACTACCCGCACCCCCGCACGTCCCGCACTGCGTTAGGGACCCGCACCCCGCACCGAAATTACCCGCACTAGCCGCCCGCACGCCCACAAGCTTATACCCGCACACCCGCACCAACTACCCGCACTCCCGCACCCCGCACATTTCCCGCACCAACCAGCTCCCCGCACACCCGCACGGACCCGCACCCCGCACTTGCTACCGCTCATCCCGCACGGGGAGTCTACCCGCACTCCCGCACAAAGATACCCGCACACTATTCCCGCACTTTCCCGCACGCCAGCTGGATACCCGCACGCCCGCACGCCCGCACATCCCGCACGGGACCCGCACCGTCCCGCACGGAGTCCCGCACCCCCGCACACCCGCACCCCGCACCACTCCCGCACATCCCGCACAGCCCGCACCCCGCACCCCGCAC\"\nt = \"CCCGCACCC\"\n\nmotifs = findMotif(s,t)\nprint(\" \".join(str(c) for c in findMotif(s,t)))\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"31475ed1-28cd-4026-ba67-0eb369b8d1b3"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"58 65 77 94 122 199 233 290 328 359 385 408 415 460 484 519 605 658 825 841 877 884\n","output_type":"stream"}]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"a39e4114-9e44-4ded-b6aa-8ca925b85932","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
