The contemporary \nhereditary model, called **blending** inheritance, stated that an organism must exhibit a blend of its parent's \ntraits. This rule is obviously violated both empirically (consider the huge number of people who are taller than \nboth their parents) and statistically (over time, blended traits would simply blend into the average, severely \nlimiting variation).\n\nMendel, working with thousands of pea plants, believed that rather than viewing traits as continuous processes, \nthey should instead be divided into discrete building blocks called **factors**. Furthermore, he proposed that \nevery factor possesses distinct forms, called **alleles**.\n\nIn what has come to be known as his **first law** (also known as the law of segregation), Mendel stated that \nevery organism possesses a pair of alleles for a given factor. If an individual's two alleles for a given factor \nare the same, then it is **homozygous** for the factor; if the alleles differ, then the individual is \n**heterozygous**. The first law concludes that for any factor, an organism randomly passes one of its two \nalleles to each offspring, so that an individual receives one allele from each parent.\n\nMendel also believed that any factor corresponds to only two possible alleles, the **dominant** and **recessive**\nalleles. An organism only needs to possess one copy of the dominant allele to display the trait represented by \nthe dominant allele. In other words, the only way that an organism can display a trait encoded by a recessive \nallele is if the individual is homozygous recessive for that factor.\n\nWe may encode the dominant allele of a factor by a capital letter (e.g., $A$) and the recessive allele by a lower \ncase letter (e.g., $a$). Because a heterozygous organism can possess a recessive allele without displaying the \nrecessive form of the trait, we henceforth define an organism's **genotype** to be its precise genetic makeup and \nits **phenotype** as the physical manifestation of its underlying traits.\n\nThe different possibilities describing an individual's inheritance of two alleles from its parents can be \nrepresented by a **Punnett square**.\n\n## Problem\n\n**Probability** is the mathematical study of randomly occurring phenomena. We will model such a phenomenon with \na **random variable**, which is simply a variable that can take a number of different distinct **outcomes** \ndepending on the result of an underlying random process.\n\nFor example, say that we have a bag containing 3 red balls and 2 blue balls. If we let $X$ represent the random \nvariable corresponding to the color of a drawn ball, then the **probability** of each of the two outcomes is given \nby $Pr(X=red)=\\frac{3}{5}$ and $Pr(X=blue)=\\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nRandom variables can be combined to yield new random variables. Returning to the ball example, let $Y$ model the \ncolor of a second ball drawn from the bag (without replacing the first ball). The probability of $Y$ being red \ndepends on whether the first ball was red or blue. To represent all outcomes of $X$ and $Y$, we therefore use a \n**probability tree diagram**. This branching diagram represents all possible individual probabilities for $X$ and \n$Y$, with outcomes at the endpoints (\"leaves\") of the tree. The probability of any outcome is given by the \nproduct of probabilities along the path from the beginning of the tree.\n\nAn **event** is simply a collection of outcomes. Because outcomes are distinct, the probability of an event can \nbe written as the sum of the probabilities of its constituent outcomes. For our colored ball example, let $A$ be \nthe event \"$Y$ is blue.\" $Pr(A)$ is equal to the sum of the probabilities of two different outcomes: \n$Pr(X=blue and Y=blue)+Pr(X=red and Y=blue)$, or $\\frac{3}{10}+\\frac{1}{10}=\\frac{2}{5}.\n\n**Given**: Three positive integers $k$, $m$, and $n$, representing a population containing $k+m+n$ organisms: \n$k$ individuals are homozygous dominant for a factor, $m$ are heterozygous, and $n$ are homozygous recessive.\n\n**Return**: The probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce an individual possessing \na dominant allele (and thus displaying the dominant phenotype). Assume that any two organisms can mate.\n\n## Sample Dataset\n```\n2 2 2\n```\n\n## Sample Output\n```\n0.78333\n```\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"2b986b1a-06be-4186-af7c-aa1cb1267240"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"```\nAA + AA -> AA AA AA AA\nAA + Aa -> AA AA Aa Aa\nAA + aa -> Aa Aa Aa Aa\nAa + Aa -> AA Aa Aa aa\nAa + aa -> Aa Aa aa aa\naa + aa -> aa aa aa aa\n\nN = k+m+n\n\np(X=AA) = k / N\np(X=Aa) = m / N\np(X=aa) = n / N\n\np(AA,AA) = k(k-1) / N(N-1)\np(AA,Aa) =     km / N(N-1) * 2\np(AA,aa) =     kn / N(N-1) * 2\np(Aa,Aa) = m(m-1) / N(N-1)\np(Aa,aa) =     mn / N(N-1) * 2\np(aa,aa) = n(n-1) / N(N-1)\n```","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"115e44b5-b2f7-4661-ae79-dc5acce6c9ad"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"afefa876-53d4-40ad-9dff-a65fa985165b"},"source":"def probDominant(k,m,n):\n    N = k+m+n\n    return (k*(k-1) + 2*k*m + 2*k*n + 0.75*m*(m-1) + 0.5*2*m*n) / (N*(N-1))\n\nprobDominant(1,1,1)\nprobDominant(2,2,2)","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":16,"data":{"text/plain":"0.7833333333333333"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"e84a3b5c-19aa-4abe-8e3c-0bc41b98a1c6"},"source":"print(probDominant(26,21,24))","outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"0.7663983903420523\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":null}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"a5d969c3-350b-4de5-83fe-d934b64bf3c3","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
