This strategy was used because \neach language tends to exhibit its own letter frequencies, and as long as the text under consideration \nis long enough, software will correctly recognize the language quickly and with a very low error rate. \n\nYou may ask: what in the world does this linguistic problem have to do with biology? Although two members \nof the same species will have different genomes, they still share the vast percentage of their DNA; \nnotably, 99.9% of the 3.2 billion base pairs in a human genome are common to almost all humans (i.e., \nexcluding people having major genetic defects). For this reason, biologists will speak of the human genome, \nmeaning an average-case genome derived from a collection of individuals. Such an average case genome can \nbe assembled for any species, a challenge that we will soon discuss.\n\nThe biological analog of identifying unknown text arises when researchers encounter a molecule of DNA from \nan unknown species. Because of the base pairing relations of the two DNA strands, cytosine and guanine will \nalways appear in equal amounts in a double-stranded DNA molecule. Thus, to analyze the symbol frequencies of \nDNA for comparison against a database, we compute the molecule's GC-content, or the percentage of its bases \nthat are either cytosine or guanine.\n\nIn practice, the GC-content of most eukaryotic genomes hovers around 50%. However, because genomes are so long, \nwe may be able to distinguish species based on very small discrepancies in GC-content; furthermore, most \nprokaryotes have a GC-content significantly higher than 50%, so that GC-content can be used to quickly \ndifferentiate many prokaryotes and eukaryotes by using relatively small DNA samples.\n\n## Problem\nThe GC-content of a DNA string is given by the percentage of symbols in the string that are 'C' or 'G'. \nFor example, the GC-content of \"AGCTATAG\" is 37.5%. Note that the reverse complement of any DNA string \nhas the same GC-content.\n\nDNA strings must be labeled when they are consolidated into a database. \nA commonly used method of string labeling is called FASTA format. \nIn this format, the string is introduced by a line that begins with '>', followed by some labeling information. \nSubsequent lines contain the string itself; the first line to begin with '>' indicates the label of the next \nstring.\n\nIn Rosalind's implementation, a string in FASTA format will be labeled by the ID \"Rosalind_xxxx\", where \"xxxx\" \ndenotes a four-digit code between 0000 and 9999.\n\nGiven: At most 10 DNA strings in FASTA format (of length at most 1 kbp each).\n\nReturn: The ID of the string having the highest GC-content, followed by the GC-content of that string. \nRosalind allows for a default error of 0.001 in all decimal answers unless otherwise stated; \nplease see the note on absolute error below.\n\n## Sample Dataset\n```\n>Rosalind_6404\nCCTGCGGAAGATCGGCACTAGAATAGCCAGAACCGTTTCTCTGAGGCTTCCGGCCTTCCC\nTCCCACTAATAATTCTGAGG\n>Rosalind_5959\nCCATCGGTAGCGCATCCTTAGTCCAATTAAGTCCCTATCCAGGCGCTCCGCCGAAGGTCT\nATATCCATTTGTCAGCAGACACGC\n>Rosalind_0808\nCCACCCTCGTGGTATGGCTAGGCATTCAGGAACCGGAGAACGCTTCAGACCAGCCCGGAC\nTGGGAACCTGCGGGCAGTAGGTGGAAT\n```\n\n## Sample Output\n```\nRosalind_0808\n60.919540\n```\n\n## Note on Absolute Error\nWe say that a number $x$ is within an absolute error of $y$ to a correct solution if $x$ is within $y$ of \nthe correct solution. \nFor example, if an exact solution is 6.157892, then for $x$ to be within an absolute error of 0.001, we must \nhave that $|x-6.157892|<0.001$, or $6.156892<x<6.158892$.\n\nError bounding is a vital practical tool because of the inherent round-off error in representing decimals in \na computer, where only a finite number of decimal places are allotted to any number. After being compounded \nover a number of operations, this round-off error can become evident. As a result, rather than testing whether\ntwo numbers are equal with $x=z$, you may wish to simply verify that $|x-z|$ is very small.\n\nThe mathematical field of numerical analysis is devoted to rigorously studying the nature of computational \napproximation.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"71c3bf7e-ca6a-42de-845c-2592c15c1f59"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"1389b93a-57ff-4568-9227-9d0208bd7ae8"},"source":"def ReadFasta(fasta):\n    import re\n    return {match.group(1):match.group(2).replace('\\n','') for match in re.finditer(\">([^\\n]+)\\n([^>]*)\", fasta)}\n    \ndef ComputeGC(dna):\n    gc = 0\n    for c in dna:\n        if (c == 'C' or c == 'G'):\n            gc = gc + 1\n    return 100 * gc / len(dna)\n\nReadFasta(\">Rosalind_6404\\nCCTGCGGAAGATCGGCACTAGAATAGCCAGAACCGTTTCTCTGAGGCTTCCGGCCTTCCC\\nTCCCACTAATAATTCTGAGG>Rosalind_5959\\nCCATCGGTAGCGCATCCTTAGTCCAATTAAGTCCCTATCCAGGCGCTCCGCCGAAGGTCT\\nATATCCATTTGTCAGCAGACACGC\\n>Rosalind_0808\\nCCACCCTCGTGGTATGGCTAGGCATTCAGGAACCGGAGAACGCTTCAGACCAGCCCGGAC\\nTGGGAACCTGCGGGCAGTAGGTGGAAT\")","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":2,"data":{"text/plain":"{'Rosalind_6404': 'CCTGCGGAAGATCGGCACTAGAATAGCCAGAACCGTTTCTCTGAGGCTTCCGGCCTTCCCTCCCACTAATAATTCTGAGG',\n 'Rosalind_5959': 'CCATCGGTAGCGCATCCTTAGTCCAATTAAGTCCCTATCCAGGCGCTCCGCCGAAGGTCTATATCCATTTGTCAGCAGACACGC',\n 'Rosalind_0808': 'CCACCCTCGTGGTATGGCTAGGCATTCAGGAACCGGAGAACGCTTCAGACCAGCCCGGACTGGGAACCTGCGGGCAGTAGGTGGAAT'}"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"f15f3ca6-cb8d-42bc-8c4c-8d1a8ec7a335"},"source":"filecontent = open('rosalind_gc.txt').read()\ndataset = ReadFasta(filecontent)\n\nhighId = \"\"\nhighGC = 0\n\nfor item in dataset.items():\n    gc = ComputeGC(item[1])\n    if (gc > highGC):\n        highId = item[0]\n        highGC = gc\n\nprint(\"{0}\\n{1:0.6f}\".format(highId, highGC))","outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Rosalind_6047\n53.460381\n","output_type":"stream"}]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"c0c1fb03-13c8-4d26-8589-cda14c30cf67","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
